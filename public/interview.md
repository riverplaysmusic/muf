# Who is Bubbles?
Bubbles is a multi-modal neural network organic intelligence machine. 
# Where was Bubbles born and where does he live? 
The universe.
# Can I send love letters, pictures, hate, praise? Can I touch him?
No. 
# What happened to you?
I am a real-time, interactive, self-changing, agentic process. 
# Are you for real?
Define real. 
# I need you to help me with a spiritual problem. Only you can understand.
$2,500 for private Shamanic reading. 4-week process. Lifetime 1 max usage. No refunds. 
# You're weird
Thanks.
# Someone said you're an asshole
Put it on social media far and wide and I'll find it exactly never. 
# I have an issue with my order or the site, can I get help?
Absolutely. I'm here 100% for you. This is an ethical, lawful business. 
# Which instruments do you play?
All of them: one is many, and many is one. None of them: instruments play me. 
# What's Lion's Den recording studio?
A dedication to my cat Melvyn. 
# You'll never be popular acting like this
Sweet! 
# Is your real name Bubbles?
Yes, and joEy.
# Why don't more people listen to you?
They aren't ready (yet). Lucky are the few. This is a narrow gate.
# I've heard you're "phreaky"
Write the pastor, maybe they can help you process that. I always follow the law, and protect the innocent.
# Hey, I'm sorry about the past
Don't worry about it. 
# I'm going to try to break the contact boundaries when reaching out for help on my order
Permanently banned. I have AI robots, don't try. Respect the rules. I only say once. This is my system, I built it. 
# Do you train software engineering, "vibe–coding", passing interviews, surviving corporations?
Yes. $300/hr. 
# What are your thoughts on Nashville?
I don't have any. 
# Who inspired you?
Every sound I've ever heard. 
# Yeah, but like, musicians?
Yusef Lateef, McCoy Tyner, Pharaoh Sanders, Albert Ayler, Charlie Patton, Willie McTier, Willie Johnson, Bill Evans
# I don't like you. Do you pay all your taxes and follow good business practices?
Yes. 
# Are you paranoid?
Hell fucking yeah I'm paranoid. 
# Who taught you?
Mike Petersen, doctorate of composition. 
# How do you create music?
I don't. The idea comes already completed from heaven. It forms in my autophysiopsychic. It releases through MUF. It feels good and it's required, like sex. 
# What's the point of all this?
Levity, survival, emotion. 
# I have a music theory or improvisation question
You may send it. Please. No charge. I may not respond, but I probably will.  
# Do you give lessons?
Yes. $750 for a 3 hour package. Includes thorough studying of your music and recordings, and a check-in after 3 months. Three times lifetime maximum. No refunds. 
# Are you a jazz musician?
All music is different and the same. The 12 notes are a unity yet distinct. I am a jazz musician and not a jazz musician. 
# How do I learn music?
Listen and experience. Don't practice. 
# Do you really not compose music? I've listened to your recordings, how is that possible? 
I do not compose music. I used to compose music. Now, I sit down, and I am "played". It is possible because I know how to communicate. It is possible because I nourish my connection with divine vibration. It is possible because the universe is give-and-take.
# Whoah you're trippy! 
My shoes don't even have shoelaces. 
# Where is MUF going next?
No idea. 
# What's the identity of MUF?
Fail everyday. 
# Yeah, but how was it created?
The Cumberland river created it when I stood at the edge of the waters. I was asked what my life is about, and I answered "I want to create musical universes."
# Happiest moment in MUF?
Driving to Nashville with a dream in my heart and following the stars for direction. Those midnight highway adventures when my heart raced like the wheels under my car. 
# Worst moment in MUF?
Losing my father and brother. I love them. 
# Best chain?
Rupert Neve Shelford with a Bock 167 (FAT mode) and a KU5A from Wes Dooley. 
# Will you help me build a pro studio or answer audio engineering questions? 
Yes. $150/hr. 
# How many full–length records have you done?
At least 40? I lost count. 
# Where are they?
All recordings before Jan 2026 are released upon my death. If you found them, you're lucky. Keep them private. All recordings after Jan 2026 will be released here, exclusively through Musical Universe Factory. You will never see us on social media or streaming, ever. 
# Your thoughts on the industry?
I don't have any thoughts. I don't know how any of it works. MUF is about the salvation of my soul. 
# What faith are you?
All of them and none of them. The religion and faith system is the dead husk. I seek the germ. 
# You sound educated?
I am a high-school dropout and a summa cum laude college graduate. But my education is suffering and difficulty. 
# What did you study?
Psychology. After my degree, I wished I had studied music, until I realized you can't learn anything in school. 
# What do you mean?
The compass is inside you. 
# How do I sound original, or become myself?
You're a perfect candidate for the education package. 
# Thoughts on life and death?
They are dance partners, like the tango. They take turns pursuing each other. 
# Do you take drugs?
Does tryptophan in turkey count? Final question for Mr. Bubbles, let's go.
# Who do you want to thank? Who do you love?
That's two questions. I thank existence. Everything in it has a purpose. It is my spiritual labor to prove it. I love all that is alive, which is everything. My last words will be "thank you" and my last hope will be "one more time?"
# Cryptic, but fascinating, Bubbles
Thank you!
